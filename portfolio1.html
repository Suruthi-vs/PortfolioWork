            If it’s been a while, remind yourself that your Instagram bio is the front and centre of your feed, and if you’re trying to grow your account, reach a bigger audience, and engage with people who aren’t just your friends — you have to ensure that it represents you in the best way possible. Anyone who stands out on Instagram for a specific skill, hobby, interest, or profession, has a bio that perfectly mirrors exactly what they do in the world, while still adding personality to their little corner of the internet.

            Best known for his orchestral music, he also wrote songs, choral music, chamber pieces, and solo piano works. In addition to a series of symphonic poems, he wrote seven symphonies, and was for a time widely regarded as the leading British symphonist. Bax was born in Streatham to a prosperous family who encouraged his music career, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music, Bax became fascinated with Ireland and the Celtic Revival. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. His best-known work is the symphonic poem.

            We live in the age of machine learning. That means fewer and fewer of the products we build deal in facts as we know them: instead, they rely more and more on probabilistic things like inferences, predictions, and recommendations. By definition, these things have uncertainty. Inevitably, they will be wrong.
            But that doesn’t mean they have no product value. After all, you’d probably rather know there is a 50% chance of rain than have no forecast at all. How can we unlock user value from algorithms that are bound to be wrong? We can do what forecasts do: design our products to be upfront about uncertainty.
